# MOVES 2014b

This readme document is currently a PLACEHOLDER. A full MOVES2014b repository will be posted to this location shortly.

EPA's MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) is a state-of-the-science emission modeling system that estimates emissions for mobile sources at the national, county, and project level for criteria air pollutants, greenhouse gases, and air toxics, available under EPAâ€™s Open Source Software policy. 


MOVES2014b is the latest version of MOVES available for regulatory purposes. For more information, see [Policy Guidance on the Use of  MOVES2014 for State Implementation  Plan Development, Transportation  Conformity, and Other Purposes](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P100K4EB.txt)

### Requirements and Set Up ###

This repository WILL CONTAIN all of the source code required to compile and run MOVES. Please note that it does not contain the required MOVES database, which WILL BE found in the [MOVES DB](//TODO: Insert link) repository/website.

MOVES uses MariaDB, Java, and Go. At minimum, you will need the following:

* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/download/) (10.2 or greater) or MySQL (5.6-5.8)
* [Java JDK](//TODO: Figure out jdk and put link here) (1.8 or greater)
* [GO](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.5 or greater)

To get set up:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Edit line 3 of setenv.bat to set JAVA_HOME to the installation path of the JDK.
3. Make note of the default database specified in MOVESConfiguration.txt, on the line specified by `defaultDatabaseName`.
4. Get the correct database from the [MOVES DB repository/website](//TODO: put link here).
5. Copy the database that you need and extract it to your MariaDB data directory.
6. Add the `moves` user to the MariaDB server. This can be done by connecting to the MariaDB server as root and running the following queries:

```sql
CREATE USER 'moves'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'moves';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'moves'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

7. Open a command prompt, navigate to your MOVES source code directory, and run the following commands to compile MOVES and launch the GUI:

```bash
setenv
ant compileall
ant go
ant rungui
```
8. Hereafter to run MOVES, simply navigate to the MOVES directory and run:

```bash
MOVESMaster.bat
```
